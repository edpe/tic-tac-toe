#Tic-Tac-Toe
The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

There are two players in the game (X and O)
Players take turns until the game is over
A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
A turn ends when a player claims a field
A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
A game is over if a player wins
A game is over when all fields are taken

I have decided to break this down into two MVP versions:

## V1 - Players decide who wins

There are two players in the game (X and O)

## V2 - Game decides who wins
